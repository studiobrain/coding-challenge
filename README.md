## Coding Challenge

### running the app
In the project directory, you can run:<br />
`yarn`<br />
`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Starting the application will also: 
* begin running the tests and will continue to run during development
* begin running and translating the css modules
* begin running the linting

_should any of the above fail, development will be haulted until the error is resolved, if a test fails due to new development, an alert will be raised in the console_

### utilized technology

**react**<br />
**mobx-state-tree** - global and react context state management with hooks support. [more info](https://mobx-state-tree.js.org/intro/philosophy)<br />
**css modules** - js based styling with indivudual component encapsulation and import style sharing via scss<br />
**jest and @testing-library/react** - presentational and context based testing suites (baseline tests included yet can be expanded)<br />
**react-icons** - availability of many of the leading svg icon libraries in one location.  This challenge exclusivley uses Material Design Iocns. [more info](https://react-icons.netlify.com/#/)<br />
**bare bones of custom 'nuffsaid component library** - ability to create and utilize custom, branded, simple, generic and data based components<br />
* MaterialUI is a great solution for starting projects and when a UI Engineer is not at your disposal, but has limitations in the customization department especially when an application grows and or updates design direction.  I have moved away from larger component libraries in favor of a yagni approach.  I have extensive experience writing, styling and implimenting custom component libraries in react and other front end technologies and find comfort in a quick delivery of said components.
